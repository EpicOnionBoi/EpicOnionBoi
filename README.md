# Greetings
Hello there. I like aviation and tech. I pretty much know nothing about tech compared to most of you here. The only programming language I (somewhat) know is ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3670A0?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=ffdd54). I am trying to use Linux (Zorin).
